       It means capturing rain where it falls or capturing the 
       runoff in your own village, town.And taking measure
       to keep that water clean| allowing polluting activities
       to take place in catchment.Therefore,water harvesting
       can be undertaken through a variety of ways. Capturing 
       runoff from rooftops.

        <p><pre>
        Harvesting rain water allows the collection of large 
        amounts of water and mitigates the effects of drought. 
        Most rooftops provide necessary platform for collecting 
        water. Rainwater is mostly free from harmful chemicals, 
        which makes it suitable for irrigation purposes.

        Rainwaterharvesting systems range from simple rain
        barrels to more elaborate structures with pumps, 
        tanks,and purification systems.The nonpotable water
        can be used to irrigate landscaping,flush toilets, 
        wash cars, or launder clothes, and it can even be 
        purified for human consumption.

        <p2><pre  style="margin-left: -1090px; font-size: 20px;">
        As the world faces increasingly critical need to address climate change,the impact that water conservation has on a sustainable environment is undeniable.Groundwater 
        is the primary source of freshwater that caters to the demand of evergrowing domestic,agrarian & industrial sectors of country.Over the years,it has been observed that 
        necessity for the exploitation of groundwater resources for various everyday needs,like toileting,bathing,cleaning,agriculture,drinking water,industrial and ever-changing 
        lifestyles with modernization is leading towards tremendous water wastage.

        Though many technological devices are being developed to minimize the water wastage, the impact will be greater if every individual contributes to water conservation by 
        minimizing or optimizing groundwater usage for daily activities. Today, water conservation at individual level has become very critical.

        Our water resources are depleting each year. Additionally, we cannot generate artificial water and must depend on water sources available on our planet earth. Due to 
        population boom and excessive need of water to suit our ever-expanding modern lifestyle, water scarcity is felt all over the world. This has given rise to major concerns 
        over water conservation.

        over water conservation.

        In this context,adopting rainwater harvesting and recharging groundwater is one of simplest and best measures in conserving water globally.This practice can efficiently
        be implemented in lieu of traditional water supplies that are currently on the verge of tapping out.
